# OCR-with-fuzzy-matching
My project involves performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images within a designated folder. If the OCR results meet a certain threshold of accuracy, they are cross-referenced with values stored in a JSON dictionary. When a match is found, the corresponding key is returned, indicating the presence of the value in the image.
